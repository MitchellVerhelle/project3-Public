HOW TO RUN:
(and other important informaton):

To continue work on this project, a few things are required. Make sure all javascripit files are stored in the js folder. Make sure images are stored in the images folder. Make sure css items are stored in the css folder.
Example_phrase_html.txt is a list of example phrases that are not necessarily used in the game.
All phrases are saved to an array called phrases.
There are three classes, app.js (the runner and event handler), Game.js, and Phrase.js. The array, phrases, is stored in the Phrase.js class.
To run, make sure all scripts are in the js folder. Also, in the index.html, add JQUERY.
Please have JS enabled.
The 'images' folder contains the life images.
The css folder contains the style.css and animate.css.


STYLE:

I decided to use my own screen animation. Also, I animated the heart flicker. Then, I added the animation that starts the game in reverse to end the game. The methods were all coded before looking at the instructions so that I could get a feel for planning a project completely on my own. Otherwise, I really like the layout of the game, so I kept the rest consistant.
